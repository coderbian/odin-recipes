# odin-recipes

My first project when I have learned The Odin Project.

The website has four pages. The main page is Home, and the file maintain it is `index.html`. In home page, we can access three pages such as: Banh Mi, Pho, Shaking Beef by clicking the blue and underlined list in homepage.

The project want to review some famous traditional foods in Viet Nam. We hope that every people all over the world can enjoy them when they arrive to VietNam.

We can see demo at address: [coderbian.github.io/odin-recipes](https://coderbian.github.io/odin-recipes)

See you later.
